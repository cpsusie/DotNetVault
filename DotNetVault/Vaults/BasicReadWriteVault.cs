    ///     2- Writable locks (allow mutation)
    /// A writable lock is EXCLUSIVE: when you hold it, you can be sure that you alone have access to the protected resource.
    /// A read-only lock is SHARED: any number of threads can simultaneously hold read-only locks (provided no thread holds a writable lock)
    /// but -- with the read-only lock -- mutation of the protected resource is prevented.  It may only be read.
    ///
    /// There are two kinds of read-only locks.
    ///     1- standard and
    ///     2- upgradable.
    /// There may be many simultaneous standard read-only locks, but there may be only one upgradable read-only lock at a time.
    /// (You can have, e.g. 0 writable locks, 1 upgradable read-only lock and (n where n >=0) standard read-only locks.
    /// An upgradable lock has mechanisms that allow you to use it to obtain a writable lock (without needing to release your upgradable read-only lock).

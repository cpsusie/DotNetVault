Synchronization Library and Static Analysis Tool for C# 8

DotNetVault is a library and static code analysis tool that makes managing shared mutable state in multi-threaded applications more manageable and less error prone.  It also provides a common abstraction over several commonly used synchronization mechanisms, allowing you to change from one underlying type to another (such as from lock free synchronization to mutex/monitor lock based) without needing to refactor your code. Where errors do still occur, they are easier to locate and identify.
